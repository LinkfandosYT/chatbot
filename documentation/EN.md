A small project I'm working on.

BEFORE: Download Python (https://python.org) and PIP (https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and execute it. Note: PIP is installed by default in Python 3.1. Just execute an included file named "get-pip".

HOW TO INSTALL: METHOD 1 Open RUNBEFORE.py lol

METHOD 2 1- Open PYTHON TERMINAL Look for it on your device and execute it.

2- Type: first, "py get-pip.py" Then, "pip install requests", "pip install subprocess", and finally "pip install wikipedia".

3- Run the program with "py FR.py".

Implemented syntaxes so far:

definition: Look up a definition.

Syntax: definition
